## Submitting Issues

One of the many ways to help us with the development of Contrivance is to let
us know about persistant or rare unintended behavior that may occur when using
it. Anyone can report these bugs or even go as far to request features on the
project's issue tracker. If a bug gets through our tests we won't know
about it until it occurs for a user. So let us know as soon as possible!

Before you post your issue, please take a look through the tracker for other
issues that are posted. Your issue may have been reported by another user. In
that case, you should direction your information towards that particular post.
Also don't worry about accidently creating an duplicate issue. We can always
mark a issue as a duplicate of another one.

Contrivance is built with the stable branch of Rust in mind, but is developed
using the beta and nightly builds. If any issues occur during the development
of Contrivance involving Rust we will try to notify the Rust team as soon as
possible so that the problem does not get to the stable branch.

Otherwise, thank you for posting your issue! Both the Dezzyne team and the
community at large will try to fix the problem as soon as possible!
